# Story

This is the backstory that the quest are based on. It isn't finished yet, so suggestions are welcome.

The king has passed away and the kingdom fell into a dark age. It split up in 4 regions which are controlled by evil groups.

## Plains

The Plains is the only region that is still free, but it is treatend by the evil regions around them. The capital Zlamouth is in this region. This is where the player will spawn in. This is where the shops are and where the player can trade and play with others. It is also where they respawn when they die.

## Dark Forest

The Dark Forest was a peaceful forest before the kingdom fell, but is now controlled by a corrupted tree monster that has figured out how to craft zombies using black magic. There will be a dungeon here (the Blackstone Dungeon) and a secret village the player can unlock where they can trade with villagers.

**Quest idea:** You can unlock the region by fighting 3 waves of zombies trying to take over Zlamouth.

## Pirate Bay

Pirate Bay always has been a grey area. It is an island just of the coast of the mainland. This is where the black market is. The players can trade for super powerful items here, but you can trust everybody (not sure how to implement the trust thingie yet, but uhm...). The island is, you guessed it, taken over by Pirates. Their HQ is in the Vulcano located on the island. The boss in this region will be a giant Octopus. After beating the boss, there is a bonus region called the Far Island that the player can unlock. The only way to come there is with a pirate ship.

## Ice Peak

The mountains on the East are taken over by the Ice Warroirs, under command of Ice Spikey. Ice Spikey is a powerful ravager living in Ice Peak. The local villages can't reach the outside world and are trapped with only enough food for one year. The only way to free them is to climb Ice Peak with a expensive weapon from Pirate Bay. Ice Spikey is the final boss. You can only enter the Ice Dungeon where he lives if you first unlocked both the Dark Forest and Pirate Bay.
