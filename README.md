# fallen_world

This is one of those projects you start but never end. It is a Minecraft RPG, but without any plugins or stuff. It's all vanilla minecraft commands, scoreboards and loottables.

Some great people helped me with this project. If you want to see all of them, take a look at the [credits](CREDITS.md).

This project uses multiple namespaces:

- **fallen_world:** this namespace is used for most functions
- **fallen_world_recipes:** used for custom crafting recipes
- **fallen_world_tools:** used for functions to actually craft the tools
- **fallen_world_utility:** used for advancements to trigger events

**Note:** Yes, I do use Wurst in the video. No, I don't hack on public servers.  
But who said I can't cheat on my own worlds?
