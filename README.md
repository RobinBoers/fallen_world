# fallen_world

This is a Minecraft RPG, but without any plugins or stuff. It's all vanilla minecraft commands, scoreboards and loottables.

While the project isnt't finished yet, there are a lot of people who helped me. I really appriciate their help and feedback. If you want to see all of them, take a look at the [credits](CREDITS.md).

This project uses multiple namespaces:

-   **fallen_world:** this namespace is used for most functions
-   **fallen_world_tools:** used for crafting custom weapons and tools
-   **fallen_world_utility:** used for advancements to trigger events

If you want to see it in action, watch this video (Dutch): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FoCYP8VX8I>

**Note:** Yes, I do use Wurst in the video. No, I don't hack on public servers.  
But who said I can't cheat in my own worlds?

## Progress

### Done

This project is far from completion. But these are the things included:

-   Dungeons
-   Custom menu
-   NPC's (with dialog)
-   Custom map made with WorldPainter and WorldEdit
-   Custom health system (but it needs to be rewritten, because it is to buggy)
-   Custom items
-   Spells and wands
-   Currency system (Rubies)
-   Waypoints / warppoints
-   Quests (three at the time of writing, but I'm adding them gradually)
-   Shops
-   Resourcepack for custom textures, models and icons / fonts

### TO DO

These are the things I still need to do:

-   Create spawning system
-   Balance combat / spells system
-   Add custom mobs and their loot (from [concept](MOBS.md))
-   Expand Zlamouth
-   Finish Pirate Bay Island
-   Add villages in Ice Mountain
-   Terraforming in Plains biome

## Other datapacks

In the video I also used two other packs which are not made by me.

-   [Damage Icons](https://www.bluecommander.net/damage-icons.html) (BlueCommander)
-   [Mob health display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9H3U8YEm98) (Cloud Wolf)

## Contributions

If you have cool ideas, bugfixes, suggestions or anything else, feel free to contribute to the project by making a pull request or just sending me an email at [robin@geheimesite.nl](mailto:robin@geheimesite.nl).

## The map

The map I used is a custom made I made with [WorldPainter](https://www.worldpainter.net). The map and the datapack are closely intergrated into one and other. When this project is finished I will release it here on GitHub and probably other places as well. If you want to help the project or want to test it, send me an email at [robin@geheimesite.nl](mailto:robin@geheimesite.nl) or create an issue here on GitHub.
