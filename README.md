# fallen_world

This is a Minecraft RPG, but without any plugins or stuff. It's all vanilla minecraft commands, scoreboards and loottables.

While the project isnt't finished yet, there are a lot of people who helped me. I really appriciate their help and feedback. If you want to see all of them, take a look at the [credits](CREDITS.md).

This project uses multiple namespaces:

- **fallen_world:** this namespace is used for most functions
- **fallen_world_tools:** used for crafting custom weapons and tools
- **fallen_world_utility:** used for advancements to trigger events

If you want to see it in action, watch this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FoCYP8VX8I>

**Note:** Yes, I do use Wurst in the video. No, I don't hack on public servers.  
But who said I can't cheat in my own worlds?

## What I made so far

### Done

This project is far from completion. But these are the things included:

- Dungeons
- Custom menu
- NPC's (with dialog)
- Custom map made with WorldPainter and WorldEdit
- Custom health system (but it needs to be rewritten, because it is to buggy)
- Custom items
- Spells and wands
- Currency system (Rubies)
- Waypoints / warppoints
- Quests (only one at this point, but I'm working on the storyline)
- Shops
- Resourcepack for custom textures, models and icons / fonts

### To DO

These are the things I still need to do:

- Create enemies and spawning system
- Balance combat / spells system
- Finish Lava Dungeon
- Finish the Dark Forest and Ice Peak + surrounding mountain villages

## Other datapacks

In the video I also used two other packs which are not made by me.  

- [Damage Icons](https://www.bluecommander.net/damage-icons.html) (BlueCommander)
- [Mob health display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9H3U8YEm98) (Cloud Wolf)

## Contributions

If you have cool ideas, bugfixes, suggestions or anything else, feel free to contribute to the project by making a pull request or just sending me an e-mail at robin@geheimesite.nl

## The map

The map I used is a custom made I made with [WorldPainter](https://www.worldpainter.net). The map and the datapack are closely intergrated into one and other, so if you want the map, send me an e-mail at robin@geheimesite.nl
